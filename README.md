# M365 Insider — Microsoft 365 Roadmap Copilot Agent 🔎

**M365 Insider** is a declarative agent built in the Agents Toolkit for Microsoft 365 Copilot that helps users/administrators query and explore the **Microsoft 365 Roadmap** - surface upcoming features, filter by product/area, and answer roadmap questions quickly and consistently.

It uses an API plugin to leverage the Microsoft 365 Roadmap public REST API (https://www.microsoft.com/releasecommunications/api/v1/m365).

It’s designed to be lightweight, web‑grounded, and easy to deploy with the **Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit** in Visual Studio Code.  

This repository contains basic deployment details for running and publishing the agent in your own Microsoft 365 environment (it assumes a proficient level of knowledge with the Agents Toolkit).

## ✨ What it does (current iteration)

- Answers questions about Microsoft 365 Roadmap items. 
- Helps users filter by Products (Teams, Outlook, SharePoint, etc.), Status (Launched, Rolling out), Feature ID and many more.
- Provides quick summaries to support adoption, planning, and release communications.
- Leverages adaptive cards to provide rich information about each roadmap item.

Suggested prompts to try:
- *“What’s coming for Microsoft Teams in the next quarter?”*  
- *“Show roadmap items related to SharePoint admin experiences announced last month.”*  
- *“List features currently in ‘Rolling out’ status for Outlook.”*

##  Future iterations

Some ideas for future iterations of the agent are as follows:

- Ability to query/retrieve Message Center posts (via Service Communications Graph API).
- Combine relevant MC posts and roadmap items together in responses.
- Ability to 'follow' roadmap items/MC posts for updates - notifications via Adaptive Cards.
- Ability to ask questions about items the user 'follows'.
- Ability to send email/teams summaries of items when prompted.
